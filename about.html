      <p>My name is Ellen Yu and I'm from Queens, NYC. I graduated with an Advanced Regents Diploma
      from Stuyvesant High School and am currently a freshman studying CS+Linguistics at Duke University.
      </p>
      <p>I am an interdisciplinary creator blending technology, language, and art to build interactive systems and digital experiences that are grounded in both the visual and the concrete. 
        I look to natural forms for guidance — asymmetry, repetition, and the beauty of imperfection, just as my favorite
        artists, Gaudí and Monet, did.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>I absolutely love getting to know new languages, people, and places.</p>
